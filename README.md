Manifesto:

I am a night owl. Some of my greatest ideas came just like they say...in a vision or flash after the rest of the world's bedtime.

What are you up to?

Passionately Writing and sharing Advanced Technical Analysis for free, researching Word Developer things, AI bot building, Learning new code, SEO/AnalyticsNumbers, Women Who Code  (who coincidentaly end up getting the Power To Fly), UI, WordPress, CSS, Adobe, Marketing, how to help the MSB's, graphics, @fortunaequitis tweeting 

Strategizing, not afraid to do something just because it isn't "technically" in my job description. 

Insatiably curious about how to build what I want. 

Remote and Roam Modes. Remote for working. Roam for networking.

My first AI bot took 20 hours to build. Building is bliss. Surprising your partner at dawn with a working bot named Legacee is even better. The praise rained down for weeks and the smile never fades. Build A Bot!!! 

The creation of things is very pleasurable, but things that perform really well and serve a dual purpose? Nirvana.  

There are people who do not get what you do, nor see the value. So find those that do; they speak your language. They are your tribe and together who knows what you can come up with...you just never know!

Magic happens with the right team. It doesn't matter where I'm at on a team..I'll do what I do best for the effort of exceleration of the project or success.

No matter how much you know, there is more to know. 

Way more.
